## Problem

This is the last time i'm asking, who the f is bson??
Attached (bson.json)

```
{"task_name":"bson",  "message_pack_data":"82a36b65795ca4666c6167dc003137372f27362f6c3203352f033f6c6c30033e292803343d2a6f0325332903282e35393803316f2f2f1c3b39032c3d3f3721"}
```

### Writeup

We are provided with a JSON file, inside which there are 2 fields:
- task_name, containing "bson" string;
- message_pack_data, containing a hexadecimal string.


With high odds, the flag is stored inside the message_pack_data field.
By doing a rapid research (and by exploiting the hint left by the "message_pack_data" name) it's clear that the field message_pack_data holds into a message formatted in MessagePack - an efficient binary serialization format. 
Using one of the many online MessagePack-JSON conversion tools we obtain:

```
{
 "key" = 92,
 "flag" = [55,55,47,39,54,47,108,50,3,53,47,3,63,108,108,48,3,62,41,40,
           3,52,61,42,111,3,37,51,41,3,40,46,53,57,56,3,49,111,47,47,
           28,59,57,3,44,61,63,55,33]
 }
 ```
        
What we have is a key and a flag, that consists of decimal numbers. Since:
- flag begins with 2 identical characters, and the flag field has its first two elements identical;
- into ASCII code '{' character dists from '}' exactly 7 position, and also 39-33=7 (where 39 and 33 are the alleged '{' and '}', since they are being positioned into the 4th and in the last element of the flag);<br>
there is clearly a relation with **ASCII** table.


So the aim is to obtain the ASCII of each element of the flag in function of key and the same element. <br>
Doing a **XOR decimale** between the key and each flag's array element, we obtain what we've looking for: the ASCII encoding of the character expressed in decimal.

```
#!/bin/env/python3

key = 92
flag = [55,55,47,39,54,47,108,50,3,53,47,3,63,108,108,48,3,62,41,40,
        3,52,61,42,111,3,37,51,41,3,40,46,53,57,56,3,49,111,47,47,
        28,59,57,3,44,61,63,55,33]
ascii_flag = []

for item in flag:
    xor_result = key^item
    ascii_flag.append(chr(xor_result))

for item in ascii_flag: print(item, end="")
```
