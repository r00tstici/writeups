## Solution

We are given an encrypted string and the script used to encrypt it.

As we can see from the source, it uses a keystream-like cipher which at the beginning generates two random bytes and creates the following ones with a deterministic function that takes the previous bytes of the key as input. This keystream is xored with the key.

```python
def keystream():
	key = os.urandom(2)
	index = 0
	while 1:
		index+=1
		if index >= len(key):
			key += zlib.crc32(key).to_bytes(4,'big')
		yield key[index]
```

The real problem is to find the first two bytes, after that we can deduce the following ones. Since it is only two bytes, we can brute-force them and generate the keystream for every possible combination. With one of them we obtained the string `Flag: there are like 30 minutes left before the ctf starts so i have no idea what to put here other than the flag which is actf{low_entropy_keystream}`

```python
for p in product(range(256), repeat=2):
    key = bytearray(p)

    k = keystream(key)
    plain = decrypt(k)

    plaintext = [chr(c) for c in plain]
    if "actf{" in "".join(plaintext):
        print("".join(plaintext))
```
